Contacts is a simple program written in Java used to create/delete/edit contacts.
It has it's own prompt and commands. 
You can run the command "help" to see what's the purpose of each commands.

## notes
It's written only using basic java programming tools such as for loops, Arrays/ArrayList, switch etc.
